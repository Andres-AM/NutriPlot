## Why this graph ?

Consuming foods that are high in protein but low in calories plays a crucial role in controlling body weight and decreasing body fat percentage. Additionally, high-protein foods have a tendency to provide a greater sense of fullness. When focusing on a diet aimed at building muscle, understanding the calorie and protein content of different foods is vital. That's why I devised this straightforward table to aid in visualizing which foods are abundant in protein yet economical in calories.

## How to read this scatter plot

On the axis, as you move towards the right, the food becomes more calorie-dense. Similarly, moving upwards indicates increasing protein density.

Consequently:  

- Top left indicates foods with high protein content per calorie and low calorie count per 100g.   
- Bottom right represents foods with low protein content per calorie but high overall calorie count per 100g.  
- Top right denotes foods with high protein content per calorie and high calorie count per 100g.   
- Bottom left signifies foods with low protein content per calorie and low calorie count per 100g.
