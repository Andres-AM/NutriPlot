## Description

Optimizing Food Selection Based on Calories and Protein.
Consuming foods rich in protein but low in calories plays a crucial role in managing body weight and reducing body fat percentage. Moreover, high-protein foods often induce a stronger feeling of satiety. When tailoring a diet to enhance muscle growth, comprehending the calorie and protein composition of various foods is essential. The objective of this graph is to determine which foods offer the highest protein content per fixed amount of calories.
